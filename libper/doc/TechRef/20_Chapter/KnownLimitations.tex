\section{Deviations}
\label{sec:Deviations}
\index{Deviations}
Following the deviations from the AUTOSAR SWS to the Adaptive MICROSAR
implementation are listed:

\begin{table}[h!]
	\pgfplotstabletypeset[
	row sep=newline,
	header=true,
	columns/Deviation/.style={ column name={Deviation}, column
	type=p{6.0cm}},
	columns/Description/.style={ column name={Description}, column
	type=p{9.0cm}}
	]{
	Deviation & Description
	%
	WriteAccessor & The WriteAccessor is currently not an 'own' implementation. An instance of WriteAccessor is a ReadWriteAccessor (with full read functionality). This decision was made because of the diamond shaped inheritance model AUTOSAR provided for the file accessors.
	%
	ReadWriteAccessor & The ReadWriteAccessor is currently not a pure virtual interface, but a full implementation.
	%
	Exceptions & The SWS specifies which exceptions is thrown by which function. Currently KeyValueStorage::GetAllKeys, KeyValueStorage::SetValue and KeyValueStorage::SyncToStorage are not throwing all of the stated exceptions, because they doesn't really help a user.
